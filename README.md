# Waii TypeScript/JavaScript SDK

Welcome to the SDK documentation for Waii - the worlds most powerful SQL API built on LLM agents. This documentation provides detailed information on how to use the SDK to interact with the system.

The SDK allows enables developers to generate, explain, describe, modify, transcode, optimize and run SQL queries from text input, as well as manage the semantic layer, handle database connections, perform semantic search, and access the history of generated queries. You can also generate visualizations from the SQL you are working with.

Whether you are looking to build a conversational client, analtyics tooling or database infrastructure, you have come to the right place. Waii makes it much easier to integrate advanced AI capabilities into your data-centric applications. Happy coding!

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

The SDK packages are maintained on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/waii-sdk-js

You can install the package via npm directly or add the dependency to your project's package.json file.

```bash
npm i waii-sdk-js -g
```

You will also need an API key to use the API. You can get your API key by reaching out to us here: https://www.waii.ai

That wraps up the pre-requisites. To get started with the WAII API, you first need to initialize the system.

```javascript
// Import the WAII module
import WAII from 'waii-sdk-js';

// Initialize WAII with the URL and API key
WAII.initialize('https://tweakit.waii.ai/api/', 'your_api_key');
```

If it's the first time you're using the system you have to add a database connection. This can be done ahead of time / outside the sdk (using the UI for instance).

```javascript
let result = await WAII.Database.modifyConnections({
    updated: [
        {
            key: null, // will be generated by the system
            account_name: 'your account',
            database: 'your database name',
            warehouse: 'your warehouse name',
            role: 'desired user role',
            username: 'your username',
            password: 'your password',
            db_type: 'snowflake',
        },
    ],
});
```

If you already have database connections configured you can activate them by key. Like so:

```javascript
WAII.Database.activateConnection(<connection key>);
```

It can take little time depending on the number of tables in the system.

And now you are ready to generate queries:

```javascript
let result = await WAII.Query.generate({
    ask: 'show me the revenue month over month for the last three years by store location',
});
```
