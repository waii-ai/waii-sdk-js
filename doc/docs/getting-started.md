The SDK packages are maintained on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/waii-sdk-js

You can install the package via npm directly or add the dependency to your project's package.json file.

```bash
npm i waii-sdk-js -g
```

You will also need an API key to use the API. You can get your API key by reaching out to us here: https://www.waii.ai

That wraps up the pre-requisites. To get started with the WAII API, you first need to initialize the system.

```javascript
// Import the WAII module
import WAII from 'waii-sdk-js';

// Initialize WAII with the URL and API key
WAII.initialize('https://tweakit.waii.ai/api/', 'your_api_key');
```


If it's the first time you're using the system you have to add a database connection. This can be done ahead of time / outside the sdk (using the UI for instance).

```javascript
let result = await WAII.Database.modifyConnections(
        {
            updated: [{
                key: null, // will be generated by the system
                account_name: 'your account',
                database: 'your database name',
                warehouse: 'your warehouse name',
                role: 'desired user role',
                username: 'your username',
                password: 'your password',
                db_type: 'snowflake',
            }]
        }
    );
```


If you already have database connections configured you can activate them by key. Like so:

```javascript
WAII.Database.activateConnection(<connection key>);
```
It can take little time depending on the number of tables in the system.

And now you are ready to generate queries:

```javascript
let result = await WAII.Query.generate({
      ask: 'show me the revenue month over month for the last three years by store location'
});
```
